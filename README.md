# Limitless-Sight

Thank you for taking the time to read this post.

What started as a spark of curiosity led us to create something truly meaningful: Limitless Sight. 

At the beginning of our final year, as we brainstormed ideas for our engineering project, our focus was on creating something that would genuinely make a difference. Instead of following the well-trodden path, we chose to address a need that could bring positive change to society, specifically for visually impaired individuals.

The idea started with some creative sparks from my teammates, but it wasn’t until a discussion with Nitin and a personal incident involving my uncle that we landed on the theme of aiding the visually impaired. We didn’t want to reinvent the wheel but rather focus on how we could use existing technology in a creative, meaningful way.

Limitless Sight was born, with the tag-line “Hear the unseen, feel the unimagined...” from a simple, yet powerful idea: to help visually impaired individuals "see" the world around them through sound. 

The Impact:

    • Enhanced Independence: Empowering users to independently understand their surroundings.
    • Emotional Enrichment: Audio narratives provide both information and emotional depth. 
    • Broadened Engagement: Facilitates deeper interaction with content and experiences that are traditionally visual, enhancing overall inclusivity. 
    • Mental Well-being: Offering content that evokes positive emotions and supports mental health.
    • Inspiration for Innovation: Showcasing the potential of technology to address real-world challenges creatively.

How It Works:

Limitless Sight harnesses the power of generative AI to create an immersive auditory experience. We used Google Gemini for converting images into text descriptions, focusing on clarity and accuracy to paint a vivid picture, allowing listener to imagine their surroundings.  
Facebook MusicGen then adds a layer of emotional depth by generating mood-synchronized background music. Finally, Eleven Labs converts the narrative into speech,  merging it seamlessly with the background music to produce a complete audio experience that is both informative and immersive.

We demonstrated our prototype using an ESP32 cam connected via Wi-Fi, with data processing happening on my laptop, which we presented as a microprocessor and the final output-“a combination of narrative and music” was delivered through a Bluetooth neckband.
With precision and persistence, we provided an on-the-go solution for users.

Gratitude:

A big thank you to Google Gemini, Facebook MusicGen, and Eleven Labs for their exceptional APIs that made this project possible.

I’m especially grateful to Archana Ma’am for her belief and support, David Sir for giving us the confidence boost, and Vaishnav K for his valuable contributions.
A heartfelt thanks to my team, mentors, and everyone who helped bring this vision to life.

In sum:
Limitless Sight is more than just a project; Limitless Sight represents the fusion of creativity and technology to make a meaningful impact. We hope our project inspires further innovation and contributes to a more inclusive world.

Thank you for your support, and enjoy the demo and product videos!


Best regards,
Team Limitless Sight
